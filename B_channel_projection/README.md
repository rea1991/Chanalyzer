# Step B: channel projection onto the SES generated via NanoShaper


### Before you start
This python implementation is tasked to load what was generated via NanoShaper and color the SES mesh w.r.t. a tetrahedral connected component, as well as extracting the channel from the SES mesh. The following external modules are required:
- `networkx 2.6.3`
- `numpy   1.20.3`
- `open3d  0.13.0`
- `scipy    1.7.1`
- `sklearn  1.0.1`

Moreover, these built-in modules are used:
- `itertools`
- `os`
- `time`

### Input files
It requires a triangulated surface (as generated by NanoShaper) and a file within the folder `ED/ED_tet/` (produced in Step A).
 
### Output files
It returns a COFF file (the colored triangulation) and an OFF file (the extracted channel).
