# Step B_pathway: channel projection onto the SES generated via NanoShaper in case of a provided pathway


### Before you start
This python implementation is tasked to load what was generated via NanoShaper and color the SES mesh w.r.t. a tetrahedral connected component, as well as extracting the channel from the SES mesh. The following external modules are required:
- `networkx 2.6.3`
- `numpy   1.20.3`
- `open3d  0.13.0`
- `scipy    1.7.1`
- `sklearn  1.0.1`

Moreover, these built-in modules are used:
- `itertools`
- `os`
- `time`
- `math`
- `shutil`

### Input files
It requires a triangulated surface (as generated by NanoShaper) and a pathway (represented via
a .xyz file consisting of a collection of lines each of which encodes the coordinates of a pathway
point).
The parameter `cutoff` represents the threshold distance (in Angstrom) adopted for classifying surface points as close or far to the pathway.

### Output files
It returns:
- an OFF file `channel.off` representing the extracted channel;
- an OFF file `structure_pathway_A.off` representing the provided pathway in OFF format;
- an OFF file `structure_pathway_A_LINE.off` representing the main direction line extracted via PCA of the provided pathway;
- a TXT file `structure_pathway_A_LINE_origin-direction.txt` encoding the coordinates of the barycenter O of the provided pathway as well as the coordinates of a point V such that V-O is the direction vector of the line extracted from the provided pathway.
