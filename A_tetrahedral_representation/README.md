# Step A: Extraction of the tetrahedral representation of the channel

The identification of the (tetrahedral) connected components is integrated within [NanoShaper](https://electrostaticszone.eu/downloads). While the packages and the procedure required to run this version are the virtually same as NanoShaper 0.7, this version can be installed in more recent operating systems (tested on MacOS Big Sur and Monterey and on Ubuntu 20.04) and with more recent packages (e.g., CGAL 5.3.1).

Two conformations can be found in `example/IonicChannels/mscl/5ligand/`.
