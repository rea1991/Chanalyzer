# Step C1: skeletonization


### Before you start
The implementation relies on CGAL 5.3.1.


### On compilation and run
Note that, to make compilation easier, a CMakeLists file and a shell file (`skeletonization_cmake.sh`) are included in the folder. An example of shell file to run the exe file generated by compilation is `skeletonization_example.sh`. The following flag can be set:
- `-i`: path to the input channel (in OFF file, as generated in Step B).
 
### Output files
The following files are expected to be generated:
 - `output/CGAL_filled.off`: triangle mesh obtained by filling any hole found on the channel.
 - `output/CGAL_skeleton.txt`: point cloud that defines the skeleton of the (filled) channel.
 - `output/CGAL_skel-poly.polylines.txt`: skeleton as a collection of edges, one per line; each line starts with a 2, and then lists the two triplets defining the edgepoints of an edge.
